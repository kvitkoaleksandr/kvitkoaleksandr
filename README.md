# Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander ðŸ‘‹  

I have 1.5+ years of experience in IT, working on projects that included both monolithic systems and microservices. My background spans the full cycle of backend work and system design: building and supporting APIs (REST, GraphQL), integrating with external systems, designing database models, and writing unit and integration tests.

## What I work on
- API design and implementation (REST/GraphQL), schema versioning, API docs
- Integrations with external services and internal platform modules
- Data modeling, query optimization, migration/ETL-like flows
- Test coverage (unit/integration), test data management (Testcontainers)
- Observability: structured logging, metrics, tracing; production debugging
- Code review, refactoring, documentation (Confluence), task tracking (Jira)
- 
## Tech & Tools

â€” Java 8/17/21, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Hibernate, JPA  
â€” PostgreSQL, SQL, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ  
â€” REST, GraphQL, Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman  
â€” UML, BPMN, Use Cases, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, Jira, Confluence, Miro  
â€” Git, GitFlow, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Docker, Testcontainers, JUnit 5, Mockito 

## Highlights
- Built and maintained 8 microservices in a startup environment (async messaging with Kafka, caching with Redis, PostgreSQL)
- Worked on high-load backend logic and inter-service communication; improved reliability through idempotency and retries
- Introduced integration tests with Testcontainers and stabilized CI/CD pipelines (GitLab CI)
- Applied SOLID, clean architecture, DDD/CQRS, and Puzzle Driven Development in real projects
- Contributed to documentation (API specs, runbooks) and internal developer guidelines 

## Methods & Practices
Agile/Scrum â€¢ Code review â€¢ SOLID â€¢ Clean Code â€¢ DDD/CQRS â€¢ Puzzle Driven Development â€¢ CI/CD â€¢ GitFlow â€¢ Trunk/branch strategies

## Continuous Learning
I actively explore modern backend practices and tooling: Kafka ecosystem, reactive patterns (WebFlux), containerization & delivery, and observability stacks.
