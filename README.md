# Hi, I’m Alexander 👋

Java developer with 1+ year of experience building microservice and monolithic applications in team settings. I’ve worked in startups and product teams: from creating REST APIs and GraphQL controllers to designing business logic and CI/CD pipelines. I confidently apply modern development practices and take part in architecture discussions, code reviews, and teamwork under Scrum and Puzzle-Driven Development.

🛠️ **Tech stack I use in practice**:
- Languages & frameworks: Java 17/21, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring WebFlux, Hibernate, JPA
- Databases & data: PostgreSQL, JDBC, Redis, Kafka, NoSQL
- API: REST, GraphQL (Spring for GraphQL)
- CI/CD & tools: Gradle, Docker, Git, GitFlow, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI
- Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito, интеграционные и unit-тесты
- Collaboration: Jira, Miro, Discord

📍 Since May 2025 I’ve been working on a project fully integrated with GitLab  
→ [https://tilapemjag.beget.app/ak](https://tilapemjag.beget.app/ak)  
👉 As a result, my GitHub activity is temporarily reduced.

🚀 **Near-term plans**:
learn and apply modern tools — Kubernetes, Apache Kafka Streams, Spring Cloud, OpenTelemetry, Apache Cassandra, Elasticsearch, gRPC, WebSockets, Keycloak, OAuth2/OIDC, Testcontainers, WireMock, Liquibase, and Flyway.
