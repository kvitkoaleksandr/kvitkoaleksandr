# Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander ðŸ‘‹  
**System Analyst & Java Developer**

I have 1.5+ years of experience in IT, working both as a Java developer and with a focus on system analysis.  
I started my career as a developer (REST/GraphQL APIs, business logic, CI/CD pipelines) and now Iâ€™m moving into system analysis â€” requirements gathering, process modeling, API specifications, and communication between stakeholders and development teams.
